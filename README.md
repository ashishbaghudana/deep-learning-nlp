# Deep Learning for NLP

This repository is hosting my attempt to become a practitioner of deep learning for natural language processing. I am working my way through different papers and code examples in no specific order. The first of (hopefully) many models that I implement is based on text classification. There are already better approaches to text classification through BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and so on. I will refactor the README as and when I get time and have more things implemented.
